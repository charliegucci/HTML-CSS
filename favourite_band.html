    The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960. With a line-up comprising John Lennon, Paul
    McCartney,
    George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they are often regarded as the most influential band of all time.[1] The group were
    integral
    to the evolution of pop music into an art form and to the development of the counterculture of the 1960s.[2] Their
    sound, rooted
    in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock and roll, incorporated elements of classical music and traditional pop in innovative
    ways. They
    also pioneered recording techniques and explored music styles ranging from ballads and Indian music to psychedelia
    and hard rock.
    As they continued to draw influences from a variety of cultural sources, their musical and lyrical sophistication
    grew, and they
    came to be seen as embodying the era's socio-cultural movements.
